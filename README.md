# Wildfire Impact on Radiation Distribution

Team research project for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2017

Team: Triastsia materi

Moto: 0010 1000 1100

---

What we know:
  - java
  - .net (c#, js)
  - python
  - html

MVP:
 - Map of Chornobyl
 - Visualization of radiation (static of Chornobyl)
 - Visualization of wildfire
 - Visualization of data modeled by radiation + wildfire
 - Visualization in dynamics

What we need:
 - Presentation (slides)
 - SOme kind of working application

- github for resource sharing
- data
  - radiation data (chornobyl)
  - wildfire data (historical)
    - https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/battling-wildfires-from-space-nasa-adds-to-firefighters-toolkit
  - model of wildfire movement
  - model of wildfire creating dust (dust movement model)
  - dust movement dependence on weather

- visualization solution for:
  - (1) heat-map over map
  - heat-map of radiation
  - heat-map of wildfire (static)
  - heat-map of radiation + wildfire based on model model

Presentation:
 - Do slides!
 - Speak with others to explain idea!
 - Express idea
 - Notes:
    - Model for forest fire & meadow fire are different!
